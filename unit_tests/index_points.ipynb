At several stages within a single pass, the respective sampled points have to be selected and re-indexed for the next layer or function to process them. This notebook aims at specifically looking at this function with its respective inputs, as for the multi-scale-grouping (MSG) version of this model, currently we are receiving the following error: <br>\n",
